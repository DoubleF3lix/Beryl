# mc-coordinate-offset
Offsets coordinates in minecraft function files. Requires PySide2.
Special Thanks to d for making the regex, and Dhranios for adding support for other various parameters beyond execute

This repository is deprecated. The license is LGPLv3 (sadly, because PySide D:). The code is such a mess and it's all hacks and not really worth maintaining anymore. Plus, it was made to solve a very niche problem that only a few people will likely ever have. If you're going to use this, I'd highly reccomend rewriting/refactoring this (ideally without PySide for licensing stuff).
